            <h4>About Me</h4>
              <p>I'm originally from Florida but moved west after I finished high school. I graduated from The Evergreen State College in Washington with a BA in Sound Engineering. I went on to work professionally in Portland, Or as a freelance recording engineer for many years. Highlights included engineering and mixing a song on a Grammy nominated album. Since then I've sought a more stable career field that is still interesting and rewarding so I've learned web development at The Alchemy Code Lab and I'm now a full-stack web developer based in Portland, OR.
    
                  I love being involved in the front-end side of development and working with others as a team. Work which impacts the world positively is something I'm always looking out for. I seek to use my tech and people skills in combination with others to create things that move and impact people.
                  I'm a musician and experienced recording/mixing/mastering engineer on the side as well, and as a developer, I love getting involved with projects that touch on these fields! I also offer a unique and valuable mix of skills that I bring to any team I'm part of.</p>
